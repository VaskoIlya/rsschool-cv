#### 3. Summary
 The ultimate goal of all this, of course, is to find a job in a good company. Decent salary, but interesting and not sugary work is much more important. I often feel that I am not using my full potential, I can obviously do more, something tells me that programming will help me fix this. I worked in the company as an engineer for a year and during this time I was finally convinced that I do not want to work in this area. From my friends and information from the Internet, I know that in programming, each task requires an individual approach, I feel this is what I need. During my work as an engineer, I have never had conflicts with the team, on the contrary, I had good, friendly relations, so I can say for sure that I can work in a team. To conclude, I want to say that I really like Western culture, I like the relationship between people there, the same atmosphere reigns in IT companies and this is an additional motivation to find myself in IT.

		int[] array = initializeArray();
		int max = max(array);
		System.out.println(max);
	}refactor: change structure of the project
	public static int[] initializeArray() throws IOException {
		BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader( new InputStramReader( System.in)
		int[] array = new int[20];
		for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
